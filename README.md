# Arrays

## Two Sum Approaches

### 1. HashMap Approach
The HashMap approach has a time complexity of O(n). It uses a HashMap to store the difference between the target and the current element as the key, and the index of the current element as the value. This allows for efficient lookups to find the two indices that sum up to the target.

### 2. Brute Force Approach
The Brute Force approach has a time complexity of O(n^2). It involves using two nested loops to check all possible pairs of elements to see if they sum up to the target.

### 3. Sorting and Two Pointers Approach
The Sorting and Two Pointers approach has a time complexity of O(n log n). It involves sorting the array and then using two pointers to find the two indices that sum up to the target.
